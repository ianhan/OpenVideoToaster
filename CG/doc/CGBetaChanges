---------------------
CG 3.0 Beta17 6-7-93
---------------------

Changes since Beta16
--------------------

- CG prevents user from dragging lines off left edge of screen. In
certain instances, characters may go off the right edge of screen in which
case they are not shown during a scroll. Right-justfiying these lines
will show the right hand side of the line. 

- Dragging large fonts which go off the bottom of the screen, you were
able to drag over the top of the previous line. This is fixed.

Changes since Beta15
--------------------

- Right mouse button abort of render page is now more responsive.

- The very bottom scanline (262) after a scroll froze on the last page was
sometimes garbage. No longer.

- A bug which caused scroll pages to have some characters turn invisible
when scrolled is fixed.

- Dragging items on a page now deletes any buffered version of the page.

- Scrolls with one character lines which go over the far right hand
side caused crashes. This will no longer cause crashes, and furthermore
dragging will no longer allow you to put characters off the right hand
side of the screen.

- Justify button no longer shows up on crawl pages

- Entering the CG on a scroll/crawl page resulted in the prop knob
not being drawn. This is now fixed.

Changes since Beta14
--------------------

- If it is unable to load a font (when loading a book), it prefixes
the font path with "OldFonts/" and tries again. This handles 2.0 books,
which did not have paths.

- Brush disk sizes now show up in font info requester.

- minor bug fixes

Changes since Beta13
--------------------

- Changing a page with multi-colored text on a line into a scroll
page resulted sometimes in a weird scroll. Now, when you change
a page into a scroll, all attributes except font on a line are made
the same as the first character in the line.

- Previously, any time you moved the cursor (including changing pages
and loading a new book), the default attributes (the ones that appear
in the menu bar) were updated. Now, they are only updated when you
click on something. (People complained about loading System4000 book
and then going to a blank page and having weird grey, transparent text.
This is why that was happening.)

- During book loading, if font load fails because memory is low, the
requester will read "Out of memory loading (fontname)". If the font
load fails for some other reason, it will read "Unable to load (fontname)."

- The default box width is kept to less than 640, and the height to 400. 
This prevents the full-screen-size box from becoming the default and
preventing further box sizings.

- minor bug fixes

Changes since Beta12
--------------------

- On scroll pages, moving the cursor off the screen causes the screen
to scroll again.

- Scroll pages no longer have a shadow priority button (it never
did anything anyways, since the shadow color always = border color)

- Bug causing garbage lines to be rendered out to Toaster buffer fixed.


Changes since Beta11
--------------------

- A bug where the CG would use the wrong key when rendering pages from
the switcher is fixed.

- Fonts with names beginning with "Symbol" are ignored when creating
the line for the switcher popup list of pages.

- The topmost line is the one which now shows up in the popup menu,
unless it is a box, brush or "Symbol" font.

- Enforcer hits caused by deleting a font, and then selecting a brush
are fixed.

- Pre-rendering of book now has a "cancel" button. If you click this,
the book is still loaded, but not pre-rendered. Thusly, moving through
pages in the edit mode will be slow. Also, when you scroll or crawl, 
there might be a noticeable delay before it starts.

- Pages which have valid buffered versions in the framestore dir are 
no longer pre-rendered. This speeds up loading, but when you edit these
pages, there will be a delay before the text appears the first time.

- Using shift-arrow or alt-arrow on a scroll line you were able to move
lines too far to the right, and junk showed up on the left hand side during
the scroll. Now, you can still move stuff off the displayed area, but there
should no longer be junk (those characters will just not appear in the scroll)
Right-justification will always put the line as far as possible to the right.

- Problems with attributes disappearing when other attributes were 
changes are fixed.

- The help screen now displays shift-click for selecting a page.

- Any directory anywhere named "_Bullet_Outlines" is now not shown
in the file requester. No subdirectories in "fonts:" are shown.

- The shadow/border priority button (this is the name of the button) now
goes away if there is no shadow nor border for the selected items. If there
is a just a shadow, or just a border, it does appear (and is useful).

Changes since Beta10
--------------------

- Various low memory problems were fixed. The CG will stop allocating
memory and declare to be out of memory if there is less than 120K
of contiguous chip, or 240K total free memory.

- When books are loaded, the CG puts up a panel showing which page is being
pre-rendered.


Changes since Beta9
-------------------

- In low memory situations, the postscript renderer might returns garbage
for characters. This is fixed - the message "Memory is low" should now
appear in the menu bar and just blank space will be rendered.

- Right justification was outside the safe area.

- "Rendering error" requesters now do not show up if a character is not
in a font. They only show up if some other error occurs (out of memory,
PostScript error). They also now show the offending font and character,
as well as any PostScript error message. These requesters also only now
show up when the entire page is rendered (either for the user interface
or a buffer), not when just a line is rendered.

- Upon entering CG from switcher, if page was scroll/crawl, prop
didn't show up.

- Problems rendering empty right-justified lines on scroll pages fixed.

- The CG sets key repeat to a nice rate. (The switcher turns key repeat
off)

- Scroll & crawl prop gadgets reappear now after the help screen,
and after toggling the menu bar on/off.

Changes since Beta8
-------------------

- Low memory handling is better. When chip memory goes below 160K continuous,
the CG will refuse to allocate any more for things like new PostScript fonts,
characters, and lines. Requesters (like Help) will still function, however. 
If memory goes low while rendering (common with PostScript fonts), there's
no requester, just a notice in the menu bar "Memory is low!" (less obtrusive).
When its really low, requesters start appearing. Now is a good time to save
your book. CG should be more robust now in low memory situations (still
needs more beta testing though)

- Scrolls will no longer render partial characters at the right edge
of the scroll. If a character is not able to be completely rendered,
it is skipped during the scroll (although it will show up in the interface).

- The Help requester shows the amount of graphics and other memory free.

- Scroll & crawl prop gadgets stay oncsreen when in page&book menu.

- If the font's rendering engine cannot render a character, the user is
now alerted with a requester. If the PostScript engine has a error string,
it is displayed as well. Previous to this version, the renderer just
gave up with no explanation.

- Requestor comes up after book successfully saved.

- Erasing a page sometimes left a box or brush on the page. This is fixed.

- Erasing a page now deletes that buffered page.

- Erasing a book now also deletes all buffered pages for that book.

- Fixed bugs in changing parts of a line,deleting characters,and
having attributes inadvertantly change.

- Transparent text over opaque shadow/outline works on key pages. Note
that you lose your anti-aliasing when you do this (unavoidable).

- Changing from a scroll to a crawl with empty lines now translates
the lines after the empty lines correctly.

- Erase line when on box/brush now works (if no text has been typed at cursor).

- Depth sorting of box/brush fixed. (Broke in Beta7).

- Clicking on text below the baseline now selects text

- Postscript renderer changes to wait pointer if it needs to render
characters (as opposed to having them buffered already).


Changes since Beta7
-------------------
- You can no longer click "through" blank areas on the palette menu
to select text underneath.

- TAB now goes over to the next 128 pixel column on non-Japanese fonts.
It creates a new line as well.

- Scroll page dragging and font changing logic has been cleaned up.

- Boxes now default to the same size as the last box sized.

- Clicking on a box or brush now inserts a text line as well,
so that you can easily type text over box/brush without moving stuff around.

- The CommonRGB buffer stays loaded when you go back to the switcher.
Only unloading the CG will cause it to be flushed. (Unless paint or
someone else is keeping it open)

- Function key commands now work from book/page and palette menus.

- If a brush or a box is the last thing on a page, erase line
now removes it.

- Misc. bug fixes and interface changes.


Changes since NAB Beta6.9
-------------------------

- Postscript rendering changes. Fonts should remap ' to something
which prints (B&P Graphics fonts had problems before this release)


Changes since Beta6
-------------------

- Leaving the CG with the palette requester up no longer causes
things to be confused when you re-enter the CG.

- F8 & F9 now function on scroll and crawl pages.

- Lines off the screen are justified correctly.

- When loading a book, replacing an unfound font with a PS or Outline
font did not ask you for a height. Now it does.

- When loading a book, replacing fonts did not update the line
heights (resulting in cut-off lines or garbage), and incorrect 
justification. Fixed.

- "Scroll and stop on last page" displayed garbage when it froze
sometimes. Also, moving the mouse and clicking someimtes messed up
the frozen page. This is all fixed.

- Fading a key in and out from the switcher works on AA machines now.
On all machines, it no longer flashes the key for a field after
fading it out.

- Large crawls had bugs. The CG now tries to pre-render all crawl characters
before asked to crawl. This should only fail if you run out of memory.
There is "safety" code in the crawl routine which should detect if
thinks are messing up, and end the crawl with an error requester.

- Changing the shadow/outline params on more than one line at a time
on a scroll page was broken. You may change more than one line now.
Keep in mind that on scroll pages, shadow/outline changes are only allowed
on a line by line basis.

- You can now only drag one line at a time on a scroll page. Dragging
more than one line never worked, and caused bugs.

- If you did a scroll or crawl from the switcher without ever going
into the book, it might have crashed. This is fixed.

- Misc. bug fixes and interface changes.

Changes since Beta5
-------------------

- Clicking EraseLine on the last line on a page now removes all text
from that line. Boxes and brushes are unaffected.

- The file requester reads the whole directory before displayed it.

- Files ending in ".font" without corresponding ".otag" files are
not shown. Any ".otag" files are never shown. Neither are files ending in 
".info",".AFM". Subdirectories in "fonts:" are not shown.

- Scroll pages can now have shadow type, direction, length, outline
type , and shadow priority changed on a line-by-line basis.
(Still one color per scroll, and fonts can change character-by-character).

- Changing from one brush to another brush did not update the internal
brush sizes, and caused garbage to be rendered to the screen. Fixed.

- You can no longer change from a box or brush to a text line. You can
now only change text to a box or a brush if the text line is empty. This
was to help ease user confusion.

- The popup menu should no longer get stuck on.

Changes since Beta4
-------------------

- IMPORTANT! The ToasterFonts directory is re-organized. It also includes
some of the PostScript fonts we will be shipping in 3.0 (more to come). Please
move all of your Toaster 2.0 fonts into the ToasterFonts/OldFonts subdirectory.
(The install program will do this automatically). Almost all of the old
fonts will not be distributed with 3.0. Only the ones present in OldFonts
will be included in 3.0.

- Pre-Beta4 books did not load in Beta4. These books will now load in Beta5
as long as the OldFonts directory exists (see above).

- When replacing multiple fonts and/or brushes when loading a book,
any pathname entered is preserved.

- The box resize grab area is larger.

- Looping crawl pages sometimes displayed garbage on the far right
hand side of the screen before the second and subsequent iterations.
This is now fixed.

- If you loaded a book, and replaced a font with another font,
and that font was used on an empty line, the empty line would still
use the old font. (Could have caused enforcer hits and/or crashes)

- Misc. bug fixes and interface changes.

Changes since Beta3
-------------------

- Brushes can now be up to 752 pixels wide by 400 lines tall. Note that
a bug in Paint rounds up brush widths to the next 32 pixel boundary, so
anything over 736 pixels wide will be rounded to 768, which is too wide
for the CG. If the CG is asked to load a brush which is too large,
it will display the actual size of the brush in its error requester.

- In the color requester, you can load background images directly into
the paint buffer. (In the past, you had to go into Paint to load them).
The file requester here defaults to your current framestore device.

- Creating a font that was too large to fit on a scroll page (like by
change a line's font to a much larger one) caused memory corruption
when the line was dragged. This is fixed.

- The brush character now displays properly on the menu bar.

- A problem which occured when the CG file requester came up on the switcher,
and another CG requester opened on top of the file requester is fixed.

- Palette requester sometimes showed incorrect color on non-AA machines.

- A blank book now only includes 3 fonts and boxes.

- The numeric keypad's "5","0", and "." keys now do not map into
characters, since nothing else on the keypad did.

- The left Amiga key now takes you from the main menu to the page/book menu
and back again. (Will require a new switcher to work properly - use
right Amiga for now.)

- Fixed bug where right after you loaded a brush or font, it would let you use
it even if it was not allowed on the current page type.

- The Save Book button is now enabled. It saves your book to the current
project.

- The Help screen is now accessible from the page/book menu.

- Misc. bug fixes and interface changes.

Changes since Beta2
-------------------

- user interface is now 3 bitplanes on AA machines, 2 bitplanes on others

- If unable to load PostScript font, PostScript error string printed
in "Unable to load font" requester.

- Bug which caused crashes after loading old books and editing blank pages
fixed.

- The old "colortoast" program had a bug in it which caused the chromafont's
baseline to be incorrect in some cases. (It used DPaint's brush handle for
the baseline) There's a new colortoast program which allows the user to
enter the baseline on the command line. For older Toaster ColorFonts, the CG forces
the baseline to be the same as the font height. (This is what previous CGs
did anyways) The baseline is used for the cursor, and also to line up
more than one font on a line. 

- Crawl pages now prevent fonts over 300 lines high from being used.

- Gaps in crawls (when characters had negative kerning values) are gone.

- Various problems with editing crawl pages have been fixed.

- The font info panel now prints information about PostScript kerning
pairs ("AFM" files). It also displays any copyright notices in the
"AFM" or font files.

- Large boxes on scroll pages behave correctly during editing.

- On key pages, marks beneath the alpha slider show the four valid ranges
for keying over live video (since the CG only uses a 2-bit alpha channel
over live video, and all 8-bits on color pages)

- Bug with more than 2 PostScript fonts at same size (hung on book load) fixed.

- Postscript fonts render at 400 lines.

- Fixed bug when replacing font with another during book load. Bug caused
crash if any other fonts where on the same line.

- Toaster ColorFonts showing up in two colors (one wrong) bug fixed.

- Misc. bug fixes and interface changes.

Changes since Beta1
-------------------

- Loading a brush now works.

- CG now works under Workbench 2.1 correctly. (Fixed crashing during startup)

- Changed Amiga outline font renderer to use bullet.library instead of
diskfont.library. Compugraphic fonts now use kerning pairs (try "Yo") and 
load and render faster.

- PostScript renderer now reads ".AFM" (Adobe Font Metric) files - they
should be placed in the same directory as the font itself. If present,
the font will load faster. Some AFM files also having kerning pair information
which the CG uses if available.

- Can just click and select "Box" to create box. (No longer need to 
select a character first)

- After loading a font or a brush, it becomes the default popup item.

- File requester when looking at "fonts:" will only show outline
fonts (not just compugraphic - it will show any Amiga outline font).
Note that Amiga outline fonts must be installed correctly in "fonts:" 
for the Amiga to be able to render them (they must have correct .font
and .otag files). Postscipt fonts, which currently use the post.library
renderer, do not have this requirement.

- Garbage which appeared at the end of a scroll while in the CG interface gone

- Garbage which appeared on blank lines during scrolls gone

- Clicking on scroll page no longer creates new lines because it
messed up line spacing all too often. Insert a line on a scroll page by
pressing <return>, delete a line by pressing <delete> or <backspace> on
a blank line.

- Blank lines are no longer automatically removed from scroll pages,
again for ease of editing.

- Sizing and moving boxes on scroll pages now works correctly.

- Popup menus now go away when you click down and quickly release
without choosing anything.

- Horiz center and horiz lower now make sure all lines stay at least
partially on the page.

- Lines may be dragged partially off the bottom of the screen. If
key page, any data off the key is lost. This is to solve the problem of
positioning large (like 400 line) fonts. Since font height is based on the 
maximum size character, previously you couldn't move a 400 line font
up or down at all. Now, if you are not using the maximum size characters, you
can move the font and still have all characters appear in the key. Of 
course, if you move characters off the key, they will not appear on program.

- Fixed bug when doing a "render line" on a line at the bottom of the screen.
No longer overwrites sync.

- Misc. bug fixes and interface changes.
